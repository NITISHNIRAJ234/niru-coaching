Excited to share my latest web development project! 🚀✨ I recently worked on a dynamic website using a variety of cutting-edge tools and techniques. 🌐💡


I utilized HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to bring the vision to life, ensuring an engaging and user-friendly experience. The sleek design elements were crafted with attention to detail, making navigation seamless and visually appealing.

To optimize performance and responsiveness, I implemented the CSS, allowing the site to adapt beautifully across different devices and screen sizes. This ensured a consistent experience for users, whether they were accessing the site on a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone.
To ensure a seamless deployment process, I utilized Git for version control and hosted the website on Netlify, which not only offered efficient continuous integration and deployment but also provided a secure and scalable hosting environment.

During this project, I have learnt a lot new tools and technology like
·       CSS Variable
·       CSS Grid & Flexbox
·       BEM (Block Element Modifier)
·       CSS Units for responsive Design (vh, vw, fr, %)
·       Form submission with spam protection (No Backend Language)
·       CSS Transition & animation
·       SwiperJS for slides (home page in the student’s testimonial section)
·       CSS Media Queries
·       Hosting
·       Fontawsome
·       Favicon
In the contact us page, I have used the Formspree tool to get the queries on the mail where there is no need of the backend language
I'm proud of the final result, which showcases the power of modern web development techniques. Feel free to explore the website and let me know your thoughts! 🌐💬
